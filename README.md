# LightLDS

This is a lightweight implementation of the OPC UA Local Discovery Server in .NET

The OPC Foundation has its own reference implementation based on the ANSI C stack which is released and maintained by them.
We had some stability issues with the reference implementation so I decided to take my own approach and implement the server with the .NET stack.

## Information

* Based on the OPC UA libary of the OPC Foundation
* Console application
* Please note that this implementation is only for demo purposes and test scenarios. It does not implement OPC UA security!
